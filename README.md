# ABOUT

-   This is a waiter availibility App, in the App each waiter has to setup their own schedule
    by selecting the days they will availible on.
-   Once that is done the admin will check which waiters are availible for which day or which days has been booked.
-   The admin will be able to see which days has too much waiters or too little or no waiters at all  by the
    indication of colors with keys, then the waiters can change their days and update the new days.
-   when the admin is happy with a schedule then they can reset the App to delete that data for the
    next weekly schedule.
